Pro-Schoolar is an all-in-one school application for students to successfully achieve their goals through the help of the app's academic management and monitoring capabilities. One of the built-in features is the calendar to schedule your lectures, office hours study sessions. You can even set daily to-do tasks that you can check off and receive notifications for. Apart from that, you can track your statistics as well as patterns to detect your progress/efficiency. There is also a robust grade management and calculation system, in which users can assign grade percentage values to certain assignments as well as the grade they received, to help them get a close estimate of what their grade is and what the predicted result would be.
